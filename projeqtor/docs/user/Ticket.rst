Tickets
-------

A ticket is a kind of task that can not be unitarily planned. 

It is generally a short time activity for a single ticket, that is interesting to follow unitarily to give a feedback to the issuer or to keep trace of result. 

It can be globally planned as a general activity, but not unitarily.

For instance, bugs should be managed through tickets : 

* You can not plan bugs before they are registered.

* You can (or at least should) globally plan bug fixing activity.

 .. compound:: **Planned due date**

Priority value calculation
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Priority value is automatically calculated from **Urgency** and **Criticality** values.

Priority, Urgency and Criticality values  are defined in lists of values screens. See: :ref:`priority`, :ref:`urgency` and :ref:`criticality` screens.

In the previous screens, a name of value is set with numeric value.  

Priority numeric value is determined by a simple equation as follows:

.. topic:: Equation

   * [Priority value] = [Urgency value] X [Criticality value] / 2
   * For example:

     * Critical priority (8) = Blocking (4) X Critical (8) / 2

.. rubric:: Default values

* Default values are determined.
* You can change its values while respecting the equation defined above.

ProjeQtOr is a Quality based Project Organizer, as a web application.

ProjeQtOr focuses on IT Projects, but is also compatible with all kinds of Projects.

Its purpose is to propose a unique tool to gather all the information about the projects.

The fact is that many Project Management softwares just focus on planning.
But it is a much too restrictive point of view.
Of course, planning is an important activity of Project Management and is one of the keys to Project success,
but it is not the only one.

Project Managers need to foresee all what can happen, measure risks, build an action plan and mitigation plan.

It is also important to track and keep traces of all what is happening to the Project :
incidents, bugs , change requests, support requests, ...

In this objective, ProjeQtOr gives visibility at all levels of Project Management.

At lower level, the Project follow-up consists in gathering all information, and maintain it up to date.
This involves all the operational teams.

At upper level, Project Steering uses the follow-up data to take the decisions and build the action plan.
This allows to bring the adjustments needed to target on the objectives of the project.

The goal of ProjeQtOr is to be Project Management Method independent.
Whatever your choice of the method, you can use ProjeQtOr.


\chapter{Features}
\label{index:welcome}\label{index:features}
ProjeQtOr  is a ``Quality based Project Organizer''.

It is particularly well suited to IT projects, but can manage any type of project.

It offers all the features needed to different Project Management actors under a unique collaborative interface.

\index{Planning management|textbf}

\section{Planning management}
\label{Features:index-0}\label{Features::doc}\label{Features:planning-management}
ProjeQtOr  provides all the elements needed to build a planning from workload, constraints between tasks and resources availability.

\index{project}\paragraph{Project}

The project is the main element of ProjeQtOr.

It is also the highest level of visibility and definition of access rights based on profiles.

You can define profiles , some have visibility on all projects, others only on the projects they are assigned to.

You can also define sub-projects of a project and sub-project of sub-projects without limit to this hierarchical organization.

This allows for example to define projects that are not real projects , but just a definition of the structure for your organization.

\index{activity}\paragraph{Activity}

An activity is a task that must be planned, or includes other activities.

This is usually a task that has a certain duration and should be assigned to one or more resources.

Activities appear on the Gantt Planning view.

\index{milestone}\paragraph{Milestone}

A milestone is an event or a key date of the project.

Milestones are commonly used to track delivery dates or force a start date of activity.

They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next one.

Unlike activities , milestones have no duration and no work.

\index{resource}\paragraph{Resources}

Resources can be assigned to activities.

This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.

Only the resources affected to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.

\index{real work allocation}\paragraph{Real work allocation}

Resources enter their time spent on the Real work allocation screen.

This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.

Moreover, updating the left work allows to recalculate the planning taking into account the actual progress on each task.

\index{planning}\paragraph{Planning}

The planning is based on all the constraints defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
left work on each activity

\item {} 
availability of resources

\item {} 
rate of resource affectation to projects and assignment rate of resources to activities

\item {} 
planning mode for each activity (as soon as possible, fixed duration, ... )

\item {} 
dependencies between activities

\item {} 
priorities of activities and projects

\end{itemize}

The planning is displayed as a Gantt chart.

\index{project portfolio}\paragraph{Project Portfolio}

The planning can also be viewed as a Project Portfolio, which is a Gantt planning view restricted to one line per project, plus optionally selected milestones.
\newpage
\index{Resource management|textbf}

\section{Resource management}
\label{Features:resource-management}\label{Features:index-8}
ProjeQtOr  manages the availability of resources that can be affected to multiple projects. Tool calculates a reliable, optimized and realistic planning.

\index{resource}\paragraph{Resources}

Resources are the persons working on the project activities.

A resource can also be a group of persons (team) for which you do not want to manage individual detail.

You can manage this through the capacity of the resource, that can be greater than 1 (for a group of people) or less than 1 (for a person working part-time).

\index{affectation}\paragraph{Affectations}

The first step is to affect each resource to the projects on which it has to work, specifying the affectation rate (\% of maximum weekly time spent on this project).

\index{assignment}\paragraph{Assignments}

Then you can assign resources to project activities.

This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.

Only the resources affected to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.

\index{calendar}\paragraph{Calendars}

To manage off days, you have a global calendar.

This calendar can be split into multiple calendars, to manage distinct availability types :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
you can create a calendar ``80\% '' with every Wednesday as off day

\item {} 
you can manage distinct holidays when working with international teams.

\end{itemize}

Each resource is then assigned to a calendar.

\index{real work allocation}\paragraph{Real work allocation}

Resources enter their time spent on the Real work allocation screen. This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.

Moreover, updating the left work allows to recalculate the planning taking into account the actual progress on each task.
\newpage
\index{Tickets management|textbf}

\section{Tickets management}
\label{Features:index-14}\label{Features:tickets-management}
ProjeQtOr includes a Bug Tracker to monitor incidents on your projects, with possibility to include work on planned tasks of your projects.

\index{ticket}\paragraph{Ticket}

A Ticket is any intervention not needing to be planned (or that cannot be planned).

It is generally a short activity for which you want to follow advancement to describe (and possibly provide) a result.

For example, bugs or problems can be managed through Tickets:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
You can not schedule the bugs before they are identified and registered

\item {} 
You must be able to give a solution to a bug (workaround or fix).

\end{itemize}

\index{ticket simple}\paragraph{Simple tickets}

Simple tickets are just simplified representations of Tickets for users that will ``create'' tickets but not ``treat'' them.

Elements created as simple tickets are also visible as Tickets, and vice versa.
\newpage
\index{Costs management|textbf}

\section{Costs management}
\label{Features:index-17}\label{Features:costs-management}
All elements related to delays can also be followed as costs (from resources work) and managing other expenses all costs of the project are monitored and can generate invoices.

\index{project}\paragraph{Projects}

The Project is the main entity of ProjeQtOr.
In addition to tracking work on projects, ProjeQtOr can track the costs associated with this work.

\index{activity}\paragraph{Activities}

An Activity is a task that must be planned, or includes other activities.
Work assigned to resources on activities is converted into associated costs.

\index{resource cost}\paragraph{Resource cost}

To calculate the cost of expenses ProjeQtOr  defines the Resources cost.
This cost may vary depending on the role of the resource and may change over time.

\index{project expense}\paragraph{Project expenses}

Projects expenses can also record expenses not related to resource costs (purchase , lease, sub-contracting).

\index{individual expense}\paragraph{Individual expenses}

Individual expenses can record expenses generated by a given resource.

\index{quote}\index{order}\index{term}\index{bill}\paragraph{Quote, Orders, Term, Bill}

ProjeQtOr  can manage various financial elements found on a project: Quotation (proposals), Orders (received from customers), the invoicing Terms and Bills.
\newpage
\index{Quality management|textbf}

\section{Quality management}
\label{Features:quality-management}\label{Features:index-24}
The specificity of ProjeQtOr  is that it is Quality Oriented : it integrates the best practices that can help you meet the quality requirements on your projects.

This way, the approval stage of your Quality Systems are eased, whatever the reference (ISO, CMMI, ...).

\index{workflow}\paragraph{Workflows}

Workflows are defined to monitor changes of possible status.

This allows, among other things, to restrict certain profiles from changing some status.

You can, for instance, limit the change to a validation status to a given profile, to ensure that only an authorized user will perform this validation.

\index{ticket delay}\paragraph{Delays for tickets}

You can define Delays for ticket. This will automatically calculate the due date of the Ticket when creating the Ticket.

\index{indicator}\paragraph{Indicators}

Indicators can be calculated relative to respect of expected work, end date or cost values.

Some indicators are configured by default , and you can configure your own depending on your needs.

\index{alert}\paragraph{Alerts}

Non respect of indicators (or the approach of non-respect target) can generate Alerts.

\index{checklist}\paragraph{Checklists}

It is possible to define custom Checklists that will allow, for instance, to ensure that a process is applied.

\index{report}\paragraph{Reports}

Many Reports are available to track activity on projects, some displayed as graphs.
\paragraph{All is traced}

Finally, thanks to ProjeQtOr , everything is traced.

You can follow-up, in a centralized and collaborative way, the various elements you used to follow-up (or not) in many Excel sheets : list of Questions \& Answers, recording Decisions impacting the project, management of documents configuration, follow-up of meetings ...

In addition, all updates are tracked on each item to keep (and display) an history of the life of the item.
\newpage
\index{Risks management|textbf}

\section{Risks management}
\label{Features:index-31}\label{Features:risks-management}
ProjeQtOr  includes a comprehensive risks and opportunities management, including the action plan necessary to mitigate or treat them and monitoring occurring problems.

\index{risk}\paragraph{Risks}

A Risk is a threat or event that could have a negative impact on the project, which can be neutralized, or at least minimize, by predefined actions.

The risk management plan is a key point of the project management. Its objective is to :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
identify hazards and measure their impact on the project and their probability of occurrence,

\item {} 
identify avoidance measures (contingency) and mitigation in case of occurrence (mitigation),

\item {} 
identify opportunities,

\item {} 
monitor the actions of risks contingency and mitigation,

\item {} 
identify risks that eventually do happen (so they become issues).

\end{itemize}

\index{opportunity}\paragraph{Opportunities}

An Opportunity can be seen as a positive risk. This is not a threat but an opportunity to have a positive impact on the project.

They must be identified and followed-up not to be missed out.

\index{issue}\paragraph{Issues}

Issue is a risk that happens during the project.

If the risk management plan has been properly managed, the issue should be an identified and qualified risk.

\index{action}\paragraph{Actions}

Actions shall be defined to avoid risks, not miss the opportunities and solve issues.

It is also appropriate to provide mitigation actions for identified risks that did not occur yet.
\newpage
\index{Perimeter management|textbf}

\section{Perimeter management}
\label{Features:index-36}\label{Features:perimeter-management}
ProjeQtOr  allows you to monitor and record all events on your projects and helps you in managing of deviations, to control the perimeter of projects.

\index{meeting}\paragraph{Meetings}

Follow-up and organize Meetings, track associated action plans, decisions and easily find this information afterwards.

\index{periodic meeting}\paragraph{Periodic meetings}

You can also create Periodic meetings, which are regularly recurring meetings (steering committees, weekly progress meetings, ... )

\index{decision}\paragraph{Decisions}

Decisions follow-up allows you to easily retrieve the information about the origin of a decision :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
who has taken a particular decision ?

\item {} 
when?

\item {} 
during which meeting ?

\item {} 
who was present at this meeting?

\end{itemize}

Not revolutionary, this feature can save you many hours of research in case of dispute .

\index{question}\paragraph{Questions}

Tracking Questions / Answers can also simplify your life on such exchanges, which often end up as a game of Ping - Pong with a poor Excel sheet in the role of the ball (when it is not a simple email exchange... ).

\index{product}\index{version}\paragraph{Product and Version}

ProjeQtOr includes Product management and Product Versions.

Each version can be connected to one or more projects.

This allows you to link your activities to target version.

This also allows to know, in the case of Bug Tracking, the version on which a problem is identified and the version on which it is (or will be) fixed.

\index{document}\paragraph{Document}

Finally, ProjeQtOr offers integrated Document Management . Not replacing a business ECM, this tool is simple and efficient to manage your projects and / or products documents.
\newpage
\index{Commitments management|textbf}

\section{Commitments management}
\label{Features:commitments-management}\label{Features:index-43}
ProjeQtOr  allows you to follow the requirements on your projects and measure at any time coverage progress, making it easy to reach your commitments.

In addition to the standard functionalities to manage your projects and monitor costs and delays, ProjeQtOr  provides elements to monitor commitments on products.

By linking these three elements, you can obtain a requirements covering matrix, simply, efficiently and in real time.

\index{requirement}\paragraph{Requirements}

\section{Activity}
\label{PlanningElements:pe-activity-label}\label{PlanningElements:index-1}\label{PlanningElements:activity}
An activity is a kind of task that must be planned, or that regroups other activities.

It is generally a long time activity, that will be assigned to one or more resources.

Activities will appear on Gantt planning view.

For instance, you can manage as activities :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Planned tasks.

\item {} 
Change requests.

\item {} 
Phases.

\item {} 
Versions or releases.

\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Activities regroupment}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Activities can have parents to regroup activities.

\item {} 
So a WBS (work breakdown structure number) is calculated for the activities.

\item {} 
Activities can be sorted inside their parent activity, on the Gantt planning view, using drag and drop.

\item {} 
Parent activity must belong to the same project.

\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Assigned ressources}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Resources are can be assigned to activities.

\item {} 
This means that some work is planned on this activity for the resources.

\section{Planning}
\label{Gantt:planning}\label{Gantt:index-1}
Planning is displayed as a Gantt chart, showing dependencies between tasks.

Overdue tasks appear in red, others in green.

Milestones appear as squares, filled if completed, empty if not.

You can change the scale to have a daily, weekly or monthly view of the chart.

You can select to show tasks’ WBS before the names.

You can select to show resource name or initials (depending on parameter) on right on tasks.

You can change the starting                                   or ending                                  date to display the chart.

You can also choose to save these dates                      to retrieve the same display on every connection.

You can select the columns displayed on the left part of the chart, except for the name of tasks (always displayed).

You can reorder columns with drag \& drop on the handle in the selection list.

You can directly create a Project or an Activity or a Milestone using the           create button.

The result can be printed        or exported to MS-Project XML format.
\paragraph{Recalculate}

To recalculate the planning, click on         .

Calculation is not automatic.

You then have to select the project to re-calculate, and the start date for the new planning.

As WBS is taken into account for planning priority, you may wish to change tasks order.

This can simply be done with a drag \& drop method on tasks, using the handle on leftmost part of the task line.

You can also increase or decrease indent of task using corresponding buttons

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If a resource is assigned to several projects, re-calculation for one will not impact the planning for the others, so new calculation will only use available time slots.

\item {} 
Use correct resource affectation rate to manage multi-projects affectations.

\end{itemize}
\end{notice}

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If the planning of one project must not be impacted by new calculation, you can use the “fix planning” flag on this project.

\item {} 
This will avoid to change planned values for this project and its subprojects.

\end{itemize}
\end{notice}

Planning is calculated “as simply as possible”.

This means that no complex algorithm, with high level mathematic formula, is involved.

The principle is simply to reproduce what you could do on your own, with a simple Excel sheet, but automatically.

Planning is Cross-Project, through affectation rate on the projects.

All the left work is planned, from starting date, to the max date to be able to plan the work.

Calculation is executed task by task, ordering thanks to :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
dependencies (if an activity has a predecessor, the predecessor is calculated first),

\item {} 
planning mode : regular between dates are planned first

\item {} 
priority : the smaller values are calculated first
\begin{quote}

if projects have different priorities, all tasks of project with smaller value priority are planned first.
\end{quote}

\item {} 
WBS : smaller WBS are planned first, so that planning is done from top to bottom of Gantt

\end{itemize}

Planning will distribute left work on future days, taking into account several constraints :

A resource has a capacity

Most of the time Capacity = 1 FTE (1 full time equivalent), but it may be more (if the resource is not a person but a team) or less (if the person work only partial time).

A resource is affected to a project, at a certain rate, possibly with start and end dates

If resources are not shared between projects, so rate will probably always be 100\%.

But if resources are shared, then rate could be less than 100\%. If a resource is equally shared between two projects, then each project should enter a rate of 50\%. This will lead to control that planning

for each project will not overtake rate capacity, so that first project planning its activity will not take all the availability of the resource.

Project affectation capacity is controlled on a weekly basis. This means that planning for a project (including sub-projects) will not be more than (Resource Capacity) x (Resource affectation rate) x 5 for a given week.

\index{Projects portfolio|textbf}

\section{Projects portfolio}
\label{Gantt:projects-portfolio}\label{Gantt:index-2}
Planning can be displayed on a projects portfolio point of view.

Only projects and milestones are displayed.

This is a good way to display projects synthesis and projects dependencies, without messing with projects activities..

It is possible to select milestones to be displayed, from none to all, or select one milestones type to display only milestones of this type

\index{Resource Planning|textbf}

\section{Resource Planning}
\label{Gantt:resource-planning}\label{Gantt:index-3}
Planning can be displayed on a resource basis.

One group line is displayed for each resource.

One group line can be display for projects level, depending on selection                            .

One line is displayed per activity. The Gantt bars for activities are hare split in two : real work in grey, planned work in green. This makes appear some planning gap between started work and planned work.

Links between activities are displayed only into the resource group. Links existing between tasks on different resources are not displayed.

Left work can be displayed on the right of task bars, using corresponding selection                          .

ProjeQtOr integrates an easy to use Document Management feature.
\newpage
\index{Document|textbf}

\section{Document}
\label{Document:index-0}\label{Document:document}\label{Document::doc}
A document is a referential element that give description to a product or a project.

A global definition of a document refers to any kind of information.

This means that a document can be a file (text document, image, …) or any non digital item (paper mail, fax, …), or non file digital item (email, …).

In ProjeQtOr, documents will reference files item, that will be stored in the tool as versions.

So a document will always refer to a directory where the file is stored.

The Document item describes general information about the document.

The file is not stored at this level.

A document can evolve and a new file is generated at each evolution.

So files are stored at document version level.
\newpage\paragraph{Versioning type}

A document can evolve following 4 ways defined as versioning type :
\setbox0\vbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\linewidth}
\textbf{Evolutive}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Version is a standard Vx.y format.

\item {} 
It is the most commonly used versioning type.

\item {} 
Major updates increase x and reset y to zero.

\item {} 
Minor updates increase y.

A ticket is a kind of task that can not be unitarily planned.

It is generally a short time activity for a single ticket, that is interesting to follow unitarily to give a feedback to the issuer or to keep trace of result.

It can be globally planned as a general activity, but not unitarily.

For instance, bugs should be managed through tickets :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
you can not plan bugs before they are registered,

\item {} 
you must be able to give a feedback on each bug,

\item {} 
you can (or at least should) globally plan bug fixing activity.

\section{Requirement}
\label{RequirementsTest:index-0}\label{RequirementsTest:requirement}\label{RequirementsTest::doc}
Requirements are rules that must be applied to a product.

In most IT projects, requirements are functional rules for a software.

A requirement must be defined for a Product and/or a project (at least one of both must be selected).

A requirement can also be defined for a given version of the product, meaning the rule is valid since this “target version”.

Linking requirements to a project will limit the visibility, respecting rights management at project level.

Requirements can be linked to many items (like other items), but the most interesting are links to test cases.

Linking a requirement to a test case will display summary of test case run (defined in test session). This way, you will have instant display of test coverage for the requirement.

\section{Test case}
\label{RequirementsTest:test-case}\label{RequirementsTest:index-1}
Test cases are elementary actions executed to test a requirement.
You may define several tests to check a requirement, or check several requirements with one test.

A test case must be defined for a Product and/or a project (at least one of both must be selected).
A test case can also be defined for a given version of the product, meaning the test is valid since this “version”.
Linking test case to a project will limit the visibility, respecting rights management at project level.

In the test case screen, you’ll find a complete list of test case run. These are links of the test to test sessions.
You cannot change links or status here, you must go to the corresponding test session.

\section{Periodic Meeting}
\label{ReviewLogs:reviewlogs-periodic-meeting-label}\label{ReviewLogs:index-2}\label{ReviewLogs:periodic-meeting}
Periodic meeting is a way to define some meetings that will occur on a regular basis.

Most fields fit meeting fields, but some information for meeting is not present for periodic meeting, such as Minutes or Status.

If is because these fields won’t be set through periodic meeting definition, but must be set directly on the meetings.

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
When saving Periodic Meeting, elementary meetings are automatically created.

\item {} 
Changes can then be done on elementary meetings. In most cases, these changes won’t be erased by Periodic Meeting updates.

\item {} 
On each update of a periodic meeting, meetings are re-evaluated. This may lead to deletion of some meetings.

\item {} 
This will also reposition meetings, even if their planned dates were elementarily updated.

\index{Import data|textbf}

\section{Import data}
\label{Tools:import-data}\label{Tools:index-3}
Imports work from CSV or XLSX files.

The first line of the file must contain de name of the fields : look into the Model class : the names are the same.

Just click on specific help button \scalebox{0.900000}{\includegraphics{iconHelp.png}} to have help on fields.

You may or may not add an ``id'' column to the file :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
if column ``id'' exists and ``id'' is set for a line, the import will try to update the corresponding element, and will fail if it does not exist

\item {} 
if column ``id'' does not exists or if ``id'' is not set for a line, the import will create a new element from the data.

\end{itemize}

In any case, columns with no data will not be updated : then you can update only one field on an element. To clear a data, enter the value ``NULL'' (not case sensitive).

For columns corresponding to linked tables (``idXxxx''), you can indicate as the column name  either ``idXxxx“ or “Xxxx'' (without ``id'') or the caption of the column (as displayed on screens).

If the value of the column is numeric, it is considered as the code of the item.

If the value of the column contains non numeric value, it is considered as name of the item, and the code will be searched from the name.

Names of columns can contain spaces (to have better readability) : the spaces will be removed to get the name of the column.

Dates are expected in format “YYYY-MM-DD”.

Insertion into ``Planning'' elements (activity, project), automatically inserts an element in the table “PlanningElement” : the data of this table can be inserted into the import file (working from version V1.3.0).

\begin{notice}{warning}{Warning:}
Pay attention if you intend to import users :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If you want to create new users don't put any id because if id already exists it will be overridden by the new (with possibility to erase admin user…)

\item {} 
The password field must be cut and pasted from the database because it is encrypted, then if you enter some readable password, the users will not be able to connect.

\item {} 
Always keep in mind that your import may have some impact on administrator user. So be sure to keep an operational admin access.

\end{itemize}
\end{notice}
\paragraph{How to do}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Select the element type from the list.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The content of the imported file must fit the element type description.

\item {} 
To know the data that may be imported, click on the \scalebox{0.900000}{\includegraphics{iconHelp.png}} button.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
After selecting file format (CSV or XLSX) and file to import, you can Import Data.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
You will then have a full report of the import :
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Data that is not imported because not recognized as a field appear in grey text in the result table.

\item {} 
Data that are voluntarily not imported (because must be calculated) appear in blue text in the result table.

It is possible to define indicators on each type of element.

Depending on type of elements the type of indicators that can be selected in list differs.

Some indicators are based on delay (due date), some on work, some on cost.

For each indicator a warning value and an alert value can be defined.

Project type is a way to define common behavior on group of projects.

Some important behavior will depend on code :

\index{project operational}\paragraph{OPE : Operational project}

Most common project to follow activity.

\index{project administrative}\paragraph{ADM : Administrative project}

Type of project to follow non productive work : holidays, sickness, training, …
Every resource will be able to enter some real work on such projects, without having to be affected to the project, nor assigned to project activities.
Assignments to all project task will be automatically created for users to enter real work.

\index{project template}\paragraph{TMP : Template project}

These projects will not be used to follow some work.
They are just designed to define templates, to be copied as operational projects.
Any project leader can copy such projects, without having to be affected to them.

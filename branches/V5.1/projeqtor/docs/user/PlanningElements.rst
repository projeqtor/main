.. _activity:

Activity
--------

An activity is a kind of task that must be planned, or that regroups other activities.

It is generally a long time activity, that will be assigned to one or more resources.

Activities will appear on Gantt planning view.

For instance, you can manage as activities : 

* Planned tasks.
* Change requests.
* Phases.
* Versions or releases.

.. rubric:: Activities regroupment

*  Activities can have parents to regroup activities.
 
* So a WBS (work breakdown structure number) is calculated for the activities.

* Activities can be sorted inside their parent activity, on the Gantt planning view, using drag and drop.

* Parent activity must belong to the same project.

.. rubric:: Assigned ressources

* Resources are can be assigned to activities.

* This means that some work is planned on this activity for the resources.

* See : :ref:`pe-assignment-section-label`

.. _pe-milestone-label:

Milestone
---------

A Milestone is a flag in the planning, to point out key dates.

Milestones are commonly used tom check delivery dates. 

They can also by used to highlight transition from one phase to the following one.

Opposite to Activities, Milestones have no duration and no work.

.. topic:: Floating milestone

   * This milestone will automatically move to take into account dependencies.

.. topic:: Fixed milestone

   * This milestone is fixed in the planning, not taking into account predecessor dependencies.
   * This kind of milestone is interesting for instance to set-up start date for some tasks.

Assignment
""""""""""

Resources can be assigned to activities.

It is possible to assign several times the same resource to an activity.

It can for instance be used to add extra work without modifying initial assignment. 

.. topic:: Go to
 
   * Click on the resource name will directly move to the resource.

.. rubric:: Project affectaion

* Only resources affected to the project of the activity can be assigned.
* Affectations may have start and end dates.
* So, for a given assignment planned work will not start before affectation start date on project of the activity and will stop on affectation end date. 
* This can lead to incompletely planned tasks. These would appear as brown bars in the Gantt view.

.. rubric:: Assignment Popup

Click on |buttonAdd| to assign a new resource. An "Assignment" pop up will be displayed.

Click on |buttonEdit| to modify the assignment.

Click on |buttonRemove| to delete the assignment.

.. note::

   * If real work exists for an assignment, it can not be deleted.
